<h1>Eric Anderson</h1>
<p class="Eric">My name is Eric Anderson, I am a GIMM Major in the 4th cohort. Some cool stuff about me is that I 
    am a first generation college student. The only other memeber of my immediate family who has gone to college
    and finished is my older brother. I was born and rased in Pheronix Arizona and hated it. Now I am 
    in Boise Idaho and life is good.
